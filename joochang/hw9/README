1.
Only removed assembler directives,
not the stack functions such as aligning stack pointer and etc.
Comments are in the program.
Real time usually takes around 0.022 seconds,
with most of them being the user part (about 0.016).


2.
read function returns a integer value indicating number of bytes read,
and this is used for eof check and printing out characters.
Comments are in the program.

First, when I had a buffer of size 1, the program was really slow,
with a speed of around 0.625 seconds.
When I increased the buffer size, the program became faster,
around the same speed as mcat at buffer size 32,
and faster than mcat afterwards.
