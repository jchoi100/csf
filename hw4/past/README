Assignment 4. Eight Bits of Madness!
README

1. thirtytwo.s

Just an extension of 4 8-bit addition and subtraction,
with clearing carry for addition and setting carry for subtraction.

2. plot.s

I used bitshift for modular arithmetic.
We know that the representation address is (y*32)+x + 200.
So, the high byte will store y / 8 (integer division) + 2
and the lower byte will store (y % 8) * 32 + x.
The address will be called by indirect addressing.

I have the adjustment value 1 for plotting high value.

3. sorting.s

I used 8-bit bubble sort.
There is the inner loop and the outer loop.
The outer loop is executed 31 times, so that all 32 elements will be sorted.
(31 loops are needed to sort 32 elements)
The counter for outer loop (initialized to 31) is pushed in and pulled from stack,
decremented by 1 every time an inner loop is fully executed.
The inner loop has counter at x initialized to 31, and this is used as index for
the elements to compare.
we start by loading $(20+x), and decrement x by 1, and loading $(20+x).
which will start by comparing $3f and $3e. If $3f is equal or larger, the carry will be set.
But if not, the carry will be clear, and we swap the elements.
We load the two elements in $10 and $11, and swap.
This inner loop happens until it reaches the bottom, where x = 0.
